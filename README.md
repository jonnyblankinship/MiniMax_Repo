# MiniMax_Repo
This Python program implements a recursive minimax() function in a 2-player tic-tac-toe game. The program contains functions to set basic game rules and parameters, and 
the minimax() function recursively searches all possible outcomes from a given move based on the current board state. From these results, the function selects the move
with the highest overall score and then waits for you, the user to take your turn. Good luck!
